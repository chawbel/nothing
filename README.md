Maze solver module.

This module defines the MazeSolver class, which uses Breadth-First Search
(BFS) to find the shortest path between the entry and exit of a Maze.

BFS is chosen over DFS or A* because:
- It guarantees the shortest path in terms of number of steps.
- The maze is an unweighted grid, so there is no benefit to a heuristic.
- It is simple and reliable to implement correctly.

The solver reads the Maze data structure directly via get_open_neighbors(),
so it works regardless of whether the maze is perfect or braided.

class MazeSolver:
    """
    Solves a Maze using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

    BFS explores cells layer by layer from the entry cell, guaranteeing
    that the first time the exit is reached the path taken is the shortest
    possible (fewest steps).

    The solver is stateless between calls — each call to solve() is
    independent and does not mutate the Maze object.

    Attributes:
        maze (Maze): The Maze instance to solve.

    Example:
        >>> from maze import Maze
        >>> from solver import MazeSolver
        >>> maze = Maze(width=10, height=10, entry=(0, 0), exit_cell=(9, 9))
        >>> # (after generation)
        >>> solver = MazeSolver(maze)
        >>> path = solver.solve()
        >>> print(path)           # e.g. ['S', 'E', 'E', 'S', ...]
        >>> print(solver.path_string())  # e.g. 'SEESE...'
